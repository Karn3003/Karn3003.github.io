* <b>[Deep Learning](https://onlinecourses.nptel.ac.in/noc21_cs76/preview) Jan 2024</b> on NPTEL as Teaching Assistant.<br> 
Deep Learning has received a lot of attention over the past few years and has been employed successfully by companies like Google, Microsoft, IBM, Facebook, Twitter, etc., to solve a wide range of problems in Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing. This course will teach us about the building blocks used in these Deep Learning-based solutions. Specifically, we will learn about feedforward neural networks, convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks and attention mechanisms. We will also look at various optimization algorithms, such as Gradient Descent, Nesterov Accelerated Gradient Descent, Adam, AdaGrad, and RMSProp, which are used for training such deep neural networks. At the end of this course, students will learn deep architectures used for solving various Vision and NLP tasks.
